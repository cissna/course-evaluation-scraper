# Executive Project Summary: JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer

This project delivers a comprehensive, automated platform designed to gather, analyze, and present official JHU course evaluation data to students, faculty, and administrators. The core purpose is to transform raw, complex feedback into actionable, trustworthy insights that support informed academic decision-making. The system automatically scrapes detailed evaluation reports directly from university sources, ensuring the data is always current and accurate. It then processes this information through a sophisticated backend engine that handles data organization, grouping of related courses (like cross-listed sections), and the calculation of key performance statistics.

The value proposition of this Analyzer centers on efficiency, transparency, and enhanced decision support. By automating the entire data pipeline—from secure data collection to structured storage and organized presentation—we eliminate manual overhead and ensure data integrity. The user-facing application provides an intuitive interface where users can search for courses, apply advanced filters (by year or instructor), and view standardized reports. Furthermore, the system is built for reliability, incorporating continuous performance monitoring and robust configuration management to adapt easily to changes in external data sources.

In summary, this project provides a highly reliable digital asset that centralizes and clarifies course quality metrics. It empowers students to select courses wisely by providing deep historical context, aids faculty in performance review, and offers academic leadership a clear, data-driven view of curriculum effectiveness across the university's major schools.
