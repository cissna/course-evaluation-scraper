# .gitignore

This file specifies intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore. This prevents sensitive information, local configurations, and build artifacts from being committed to the repository.

## Ignored Patterns

### macOS System Files

-   `.DS_Store`: Ignores the macOS "Desktop Services Store" files, which store custom attributes of a folder such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. These are specific to an individual's machine and not relevant to the project.

### Python Artifacts

-   `__pycache__/`: Ignores directories containing Python bytecode. These are automatically generated by the Python interpreter to speed up subsequent executions and are not part of the source code.
-   `.venv/`: Ignores Python virtual environment directories. These contain project-specific interpreters and dependencies, which should be managed by `requirements.txt` and created locally by each developer.

### Node.js Dependencies

-   `node_modules/`: Ignores the directory containing all of the project's frontend dependencies. This directory can be very large and its contents can be reproduced by running `npm install` based on `package.json`.

### Environment & Configuration

-   `.env`: Ignores files used to store environment variables, such as database connection strings or API keys. These are sensitive and should not be committed to version control.
-   `.env*.local`: Ignores local environment override files (e.g., `.env.development.local`). This pattern allows developers to maintain local environment configurations without affecting the shared repository.

### Logs & Deployment Artifacts

-   `output.log`: Ignores custom log files. Log files are generated during runtime and are specific to a single session or environment.
-   `.vercel`: Ignores the directory containing Vercel deployment-related files and build outputs. These are generated during the deployment process and are not part of the application's source.
