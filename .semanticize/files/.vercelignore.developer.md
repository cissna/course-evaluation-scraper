# Vercel Ignore File (`.vercelignore`)

This file specifies which files and directories should be excluded from the deployment to Vercel. Its primary purpose is to ensure that only the necessary source code and assets are uploaded, resulting in smaller, faster, and more secure deployments.

## High-Level Summary

The `.vercelignore` file prevents local development configurations, temporary data files, Python virtual environments, and one-off scripts from being included in the production build. The application is designed to be deployed as a stateless serverless function (backend) and a static site (frontend), relying on a Supabase database for persistence, not local data files.

## Ignored Components Breakdown

### Python Environment and Cache

- **Patterns**: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- **Purpose**: These patterns exclude Python virtual environments and compiled cache files. Vercel creates its own isolated environment and installs dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`. Including local environment files would bloat the deployment and could cause conflicts.

### Local Development Files

- **Patterns**: `.vscode/`, `*.sublime-project`, `*.sublime-workspace`
- **Purpose**: These files are specific to local code editors (VS Code, Sublime Text) and contain user-specific settings. They are not part of the application's source code and have no role in the production environment.

### Local Data and Report Files

- **Patterns**: `data.json`, `metadata.json`, `course_groupings.json`, `failed.json`, `batch_scrape_report_*.json`
- **Purpose**: These files represent the application's previous file-based storage system. Since the project has migrated to a Supabase database, these local JSON files are obsolete for the deployed application. They are ignored to prevent stale or development-specific data from being accidentally used or exposed.

### Scripts and Miscellaneous Artifacts

- **Patterns**: `jhu_as_en_courses.txt`, `one-time-scripts/`
- **Purpose**:
    - `one-time-scripts/`: This directory contains utility and maintenance scripts for tasks like database migration or data export. These are for development purposes only and are not part of the running application.
    - `jhu_as_en_courses.txt`: A static data file likely used by one of the local scripts. It is not needed by the deployed application.
