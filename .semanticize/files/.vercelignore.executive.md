The `.vercelignore` file acts as a "do not upload" list for our web application's deployment process. It specifies which files and folders should be excluded from the final, live version of the site.

This configuration is essential for maintaining a secure and efficient application. By preventing temporary data, local development settings, and internal scripts from being published, we protect sensitive information and reduce clutter. This practice streamlines the deployment process, improves application performance, and ensures that only the necessary components are made public, ultimately enhancing security and reducing operational overhead.
