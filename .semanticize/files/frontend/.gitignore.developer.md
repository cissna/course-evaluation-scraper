# `frontend/.gitignore`

This file specifies files and directories that Git should intentionally ignore for the frontend React application. Excluding these files prevents bloating the repository with generated artifacts, local configurations, and user-specific files.

## Key Ignored Patterns

### Dependency Management
- **/node_modules, /.pnp, .pnp.js**: These entries exclude the directories and files where project dependencies are installed by `npm` or `yarn`. These packages are fetched by running `npm install` or `yarn install` based on `package.json` and should not be part of the version-controlled source code.

### Build and Test Outputs
- **/build**: This directory contains the compiled, production-ready static files generated by the React build process. It's a build artifact and is not tracked.
- **/coverage**: This directory holds reports generated by testing frameworks that measure code coverage. Like other build artifacts, it is generated on-demand and excluded from the repository.

### Environment Configuration
- **.env.***: All files matching `.env.*` (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`) are ignored. These files are used to store environment-specific variables, including sensitive data like API keys or local database URLs. Each developer is expected to maintain their own local environment files, and they must never be committed to the repository to protect secrets.

### Miscellaneous
- **.DS_Store**: This is a system file created by macOS and is irrelevant to the project.
- **npm-debug.log*, yarn-debug.log*, yarn-error.log***: These are log files generated by package managers during errors or debugging sessions. They are temporary and specific to a developer's machine.
