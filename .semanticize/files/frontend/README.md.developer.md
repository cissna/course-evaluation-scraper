This document is the standard boilerplate README generated by Create React App (CRA). It outlines the basic scripts available for managing the frontend application lifecycle.

### Core Scripts

-   **`npm start`**: This command runs the application in a local development environment. It enables features like hot-reloading, which automatically updates the application in the browser as code changes are made, providing a live feedback loop for developers.
-   **`npm test`**: Executes the test suite for the application using the built-in test runner (Jest). It typically runs in an interactive "watch mode" that re-runs tests automatically when files are changed.
-   **`npm run build`**: This script bundles the React application for a production environment. It performs optimizations such as code minification, tree shaking, and hashing filenames for caching. The output is a set of static files in the `build/` directory, ready for deployment.
-   **`npm run eject`**: A permanent, one-way operation that unpacks the managed configuration of Create React App. It exposes the underlying build tools and settings (like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint), giving developers full control over the project's build process. This is an advanced step and is irreversible.

The remainder of the file consists of links to external documentation for Create React App and React, which serve as resources for learning and troubleshooting.
