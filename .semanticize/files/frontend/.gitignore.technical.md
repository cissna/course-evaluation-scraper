- `.DS_Store`: A metadata file automatically created by macOS's Finder in any directory it accesses. It stores folder-specific view options and is not relevant to the project itself.
- `.env.*.local`: These files are used by Create React App and other modern frontend frameworks to manage environment variables. The `.local` suffix signifies that these files are for local overrides and should not be committed to the repository. They are intended for developer-specific settings or to hold sensitive information like API keys, which should never be hardcoded in the repository.
- `npm-debug.log*`, `yarn-debug.log*`, `yarn-error.log*`: These are log files generated by `npm` and `yarn` when they encounter errors or are run in debug mode. They are useful for local debugging but are not part of the application's source code and are therefore ignored. The `*` wildcard ensures that any rotated or timestamped versions of these log files are also ignored.
