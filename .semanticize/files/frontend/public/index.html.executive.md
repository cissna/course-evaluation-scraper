This file is the main entry point for the JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer application. It provides the foundational web page that loads in a user's browser, setting the stage for the entire interactive experience. When a user navigates to the website, this is the first component that loads, preparing their browser to run the course analysis tool.

The business value of this file is to deliver the application to the end-user. It establishes the application's identity with the title "JHU Course Evaluations" and acts as the essential container that holds and launches all user-facing features. Without this core component, users would not be able to access or interact with any of the course search, analysis, or data visualization tools.
