# `App.test.js`

This file contains a basic test suite for the main `App` component. It uses the React Testing Library to ensure that the component renders correctly.

## Test: `renders learn react link`

- **Purpose**: This is a default test case generated by `create-react-app`. It verifies that the `App` component renders without errors.
- **Behavior**: It renders the `App` component and then checks if an element containing the text "learn react" (case-insensitive) is present in the document. This confirms that the component has mounted and displayed its initial content as expected.
