-   **Line 21**: The root element is a `div` with the class `grace-period-warning`, which serves as the main container for styling.
-   **Line 23-25**: A `span` with the class `warning-text` displays the dynamic warning message, embedding the `current_period` and `last_scrape_date` from the `gracePeriodInfo` prop.
-   **Line 26-32**: A `button` element is rendered for the user action.
    -   `onClick`: The `handleRecheck` function is bound to the button's click event.
    -   `disabled`: The button's disabled status is directly tied to the `isRechecking` state. It is disabled while the recheck is in progress.
    -   **Button Text**: A ternary operator checks the `isRechecking` state to conditionally render the button's text as either "Rechecking..." (if `true`) or "Recheck" (if `false`).

## 5. Styling

-   The component's visual appearance is controlled by styles defined in the external stylesheet `GracePeriodWarning.css`, which is imported at the top of the file.
-   CSS classes used are `grace-period-warning`, `warning-content`, `warning-text`, and `recheck-button`.

## 6. Dependencies

-   **`react`**: The core React library, with the `useState` hook being specifically used for state management.
-   **`./GracePeriodWarning.css`**: Local CSS module for component-specific styles.
