# `Footer.css` Developer Documentation

This file provides the styles for the `Footer` component, creating a collapsible footer section for the application.

## Component Styling

### `.app-footer`
- **Purpose**: Defines the main container for the entire footer.
- **Styling**: It centers the content, adds padding, and places a solid border at the top to visually separate it from the main application content.

### `.footer-toggle`
- **Purpose**: Styles the interactive element (likely a button or div) that the user clicks to expand or collapse the footer content.
- **Styling**: It changes the cursor to a pointer to indicate it's clickable and makes the text bold.

### `.footer-toggle .caret` & `.footer-toggle .caret.open`
- **Purpose**: Styles an indicator icon (the "caret") within the toggle button to show the current state (open/closed).
- **Interaction**:
    - A CSS transition is applied to the `transform` property, allowing the caret to animate smoothly.
    - When the `.open` class is added to the caret's parent, the caret rotates 180 degrees, visually signaling that the content area is expanded.

### `.footer-content`
- **Purpose**: Styles the collapsible area that holds the detailed footer information.
- **Styling**: This class adds top margin and padding, along with a dashed border, to separate the content from the toggle switch. This content is presumably shown or hidden by the component's JavaScript logic.
