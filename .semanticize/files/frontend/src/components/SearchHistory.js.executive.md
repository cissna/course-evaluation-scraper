The Search History feature enhances the user experience by providing a dropdown list of recently viewed courses. When a user interacts with the search bar, this component displays their past searches, allowing for quick and easy navigation back to previously viewed course evaluations. This saves users time and effort, as they do not need to recall and re-type course information for frequently accessed items.

This component's business value lies in improving user retention and engagement. By creating a more efficient and personalized workflow, it makes the application more convenient and user-friendly. The feature also includes options for users to manage their history by removing single entries or clearing the entire list, giving them control over their data and fostering trust in the platform. A seamless and helpful user journey encourages more frequent and prolonged use of the application.
