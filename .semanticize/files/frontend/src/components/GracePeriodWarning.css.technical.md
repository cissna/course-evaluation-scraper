# Technical Documentation for `GracePeriodWarning.css`

## 1. Overview

This CSS file provides the styling for the `GracePeriodWarning` component. It defines a consistent visual theme for a warning message, including a distinct color scheme, layout, and responsive behavior. The design is centered around a yellow "warning" aesthetic and uses Flexbox for layout management.

## 2. CSS Rules and Implementation Details

### 2.1. `.grace-period-warning`

This is the main container for the entire warning component.

- **Purpose**: To create the visual bounding box for the warning message.
- **Styling**:
  - `background-color: #fef3cd;`: A light, pale yellow background color, commonly used for informational or warning messages.
  - `border: 2px solid #fdc935;`: A solid, more saturated yellow border that makes the component stand out.
  - `padding: 12px 16px;`: Applies internal spacing (12px top/bottom, 16px left/right) to prevent content from touching the edges.
  - `margin: 16px 0;`: Applies external spacing (16px top/bottom) to separate the component from other elements on the page.
  - `color: #856404;`: Sets the default text color to a dark, brownish-yellow, ensuring good readability against the light yellow background.

### 2.2. `.warning-content`

This class styles the direct child of the main container, which holds the warning text and the action button.

- **Purpose**: To arrange the text and button horizontally and manage their alignment.
- **Layout (Flexbox)**:
  - `display: flex;`: Establishes a flex container, arranging its children (the text and button) in a row by default.
  - `align-items: center;`: Vertically centers the flex items within the container.
  - `justify-content: space-between;`: Distributes space between the items, pushing the text to the left and the button to the far right.
  - `gap: 16px;`: Ensures a minimum of 16px of space between the text and the button.
  - `flex-wrap: wrap;`: Allows the items to wrap onto a new line if the container becomes too narrow, preventing overflow.

### 2.3. `.warning-text`

This class styles the text portion of the warning message.

- **Purpose**: To control the layout and typography of the warning text.
- **Styling**:
  - `flex: 1;`: A flexbox property that allows this element to grow and occupy any available free space in the flex container. This ensures the text takes up the remaining width not used by the button.
  - `font-size: 14px;`: Sets a standard, readable font size.
  - `line-height: 1.4;`: Increases the space between lines of text for better readability.

### 2.4. `.recheck-button`

This class defines the base style for the "Recheck" button.

- **Purpose**: To create a visually distinct and interactive button that matches the warning theme.
- **Styling**:
  - `background-color: #fdc935;`: A solid yellow background that matches the container's border color.
  - `border: 1px solid #d39e00;`: A slightly darker yellow border to give the button definition.
  - `color: #856404;`: The same dark text color used elsewhere in the component for consistency.
  - `padding: 6px 12px;`: Internal spacing to give the button comfortable dimensions.
  - `cursor: pointer;`: Changes the mouse cursor to a pointer on hover, indicating it is clickable.
  - `font-size: 14px;`: Matches the font size of the warning text.
  - `font-weight: 500;`: A medium font weight to make the button text slightly bolder than the body text.
  - `white-space: nowrap;`: Prevents the button text from wrapping to a new line.
  - `transition: background-color 0.2s ease;`: Adds a smooth, 0.2-second transition effect specifically for the `background-color` property, creating a polished hover effect.

### 2.5. Button States

These rules define the appearance of the button in different interactive states.

- **`.recheck-button:hover:not(:disabled)`**:
  - **Purpose**: To provide visual feedback when a user hovers over the *enabled* button.
  - **Styling**:
    - `background-color: #e6b800;`: Darkens the background color on hover, a common UI pattern for indicating interactivity. The `:not(:disabled)` selector ensures this effect does not apply if the button is disabled.

- **`.recheck-button:disabled`**:
  - **Purpose**: To visually indicate that the button is not currently interactive.
  - **Styling**:
    - `opacity: 0.6;`: Reduces the button's opacity, making it appear faded or "grayed out."
    - `cursor: not-allowed;`: Changes the mouse cursor to a "not-allowed" symbol (a circle with a slash) when hovering over the disabled button.

## 3. Responsive Design

This section handles adjustments for smaller screen sizes.

- **`@media (max-width: 768px)`**: This media query applies the nested styles only when the viewport width is 768 pixels or less (typical for tablets and mobile devices).

  - **`.warning-content`**:
    - **Purpose**: To switch from a horizontal to a vertical layout on small screens.
    - `flex-direction: column;`: Stacks the flex items (text and button) vertically.
    - `align-items: stretch;`: Stretches the items to fill the full width of the container.

  - **`.recheck-button`**:
    - **Purpose**: To control the button's alignment within the new vertical layout.
    - `align-self: flex-end;`: Overrides the parent's `align-items: stretch` and aligns the button to the right side of the container, maintaining a consistent position for the action element.
