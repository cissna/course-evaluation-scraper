The GracePeriodWarning component displays a timely notification to users when they are viewing a course for which new evaluation data might have recently become available. This situation occurs during a "grace period" immediately following an academic semester, a window where final evaluations are often released but have not yet been automatically collected by our system. The component informs the user that newer data may exist and provides a simple one-click option to check for it.

This feature provides significant business value by ensuring users have access to the most current information possible. By empowering users to initiate a data refresh on-demand, we enhance their confidence in the platform and prevent the perception that our data is outdated. This proactive approach improves the overall user experience, making the application feel more responsive and reliable, which encourages continued engagement and trust in the data provided.
