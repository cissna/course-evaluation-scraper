The Course Search component provides the primary search functionality for the application, allowing users to find course evaluation data. Users can enter either a specific course code (e.g., "AS.180.101") or a general course name (e.g., "Introduction to Psychology") to locate the information they need. This component serves as the main entry point for users to access the core features of the platform.

This feature's business value lies in its ability to provide a simple and intuitive gateway to the application's data. By supporting multiple search methods, it accommodates various user needs, from those who know the exact course they are looking for to those who are exploring more broadly. The component also enhances user experience by remembering and displaying recently searched courses, making it faster and more convenient for users to access frequently viewed information and encouraging continued use of the application.
