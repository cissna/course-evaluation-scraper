This file defines the visual appearance of the "Grace Period Warning" banner. This banner is a notification that informs users when the course evaluation data they are viewing may be slightly out-of-date. This situation occurs during a specific time window when new evaluations are expected to be released but have not yet been automatically collected by the system.

The primary business value of this component is to maintain transparency and manage user expectations regarding the freshness of the data. By clearly communicating that newer information might be available, it builds user trust. The component also styles a "Recheck" button, which empowers users to initiate an immediate data update for a specific course. This provides a proactive and responsive user experience, allowing engaged users to access the most current information on-demand without waiting for the next scheduled system update.
