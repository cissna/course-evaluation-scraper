The AdvancedOptions component provides users with a powerful and intuitive way to customize how they view and analyze course evaluation data. It allows users to filter the data to a specific range of years, choose which statistical metrics are displayed, and group the results by various criteria such as professor, semester, or course name. This transforms the application from a simple data display into a dynamic and interactive analysis tool, enabling users to tailor the information to their specific needs.

The business value of this component lies in its ability to unlock deeper, more personalized insights from the course evaluation data. By giving users granular control, it empowers them to answer specific questions and uncover trends that would otherwise be hidden in the raw data. For example, a student can easily compare evaluations for the same course taught by different professors, while a department head can track a course's performance over several years. This flexibility supports more informed decision-making for all users, from students selecting courses to administrators evaluating academic performance.
