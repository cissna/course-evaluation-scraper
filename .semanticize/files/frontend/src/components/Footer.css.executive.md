This component styles the footer section that appears at the bottom of every page. It provides a clean, standardized look for the footer and includes a toggle feature that allows users to expand or collapse a section to view additional information.

The primary business value of this design is to maintain a clean and uncluttered user interface. By hiding supplementary details (like an "About" section or other secondary information) behind a user-controlled toggle, the application keeps the focus on its main content and features. This approach ensures that important information is still easily accessible to users who seek it, without distracting from the core user experience, contributing to a more professional and polished feel.
