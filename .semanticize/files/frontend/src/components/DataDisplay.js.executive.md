The Data Display component is responsible for presenting the results of a course analysis in a clear and structured table. It allows users to view and compare different course groups based on the specific statistical measures they have chosen to see. If there is an issue or if no data is available, the component provides helpful messages to guide the user.

This component's primary business value lies in making complex data easily understandable and actionable. By organizing the analysis into a simple table, it helps users make informed decisions without needing to sift through raw numbers. Furthermore, it includes a crucial feature that allows users to download the displayed data as a standard CSV file. This export capability enables users to save the results for their records, share them with others, or perform their own offline analysis, significantly increasing the utility of the application.
