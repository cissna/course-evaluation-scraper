## Component: Search Results Display

This component is responsible for presenting the outcomes of a user's search query, typically for courses or items within the application. When a user enters search terms, this screen fetches the relevant listings from the system's backend data source, organizes them, and displays them in a clear, navigable list. It handles the loading process, shows informative messages if no results are found, and manages the display of results across multiple pages, allowing users to load more items as needed.

The business value of this component is direct user empowerment and efficient information retrieval. By quickly and reliably displaying relevant search results, it allows users to find the specific courses or items they are looking for without having to browse extensive catalogs manually. This immediate access improves user satisfaction, reduces time spent searching, and facilitates faster progression to the next step, such as viewing details or making a selection.
