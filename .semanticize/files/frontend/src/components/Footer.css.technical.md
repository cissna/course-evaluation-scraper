# Technical Documentation for `Footer.css`

## 1. Overview

This CSS file provides the styling for a collapsible footer component in the React application. It defines the layout, appearance, and interactive animations for the footer, its toggle control, and the content area that can be shown or hidden. The styling creates a clear visual hierarchy and a smooth user experience for expanding and collapsing the footer.

## 2. CSS Class Selectors

### `.app-footer`

This class styles the main container for the entire footer section.

-   **`text-align: center;`**: Centers all inline content within the footer, including the toggle button and any text.
-   **`padding: 20px;`**: Applies 20 pixels of padding on all four sides of the footer container, providing internal spacing between the content and the container's edges.
-   **`margin-top: 40px;`**: Adds 40 pixels of margin above the footer, creating vertical separation from the main content of the page.
-   **`border-top: 1px solid #ccc;`**: Places a 1-pixel thick, solid, light-gray (`#ccc`) border at the top of the footer, visually separating it from the content above.

### `.footer-toggle`

This class styles the clickable element (likely a `<div>` or `<span>`) that controls the visibility of the footer's content.

-   **`cursor: pointer;`**: Changes the mouse cursor to a pointer (hand icon) when hovering over the element, indicating to the user that it is interactive.
-   **`display: inline-block;`**: Allows the element to sit inline with other content while also enabling block-level properties like padding and margin.
-   **`font-weight: bold;`**: Renders the text within the toggle element in a bold font weight.

### `.footer-toggle .caret`

This styles an element (e.g., an icon) inside the `.footer-toggle` that visually indicates the collapsible state (e.g., an arrow or chevron).

-   **`display: inline-block;`**: Ensures the caret can be positioned next to the toggle text.
-   **`margin-left: 8px;`**: Adds 8 pixels of space to the left of the caret, separating it from the toggle's text.
-   **`transition: transform 0.3s ease;`**: Defines a smooth animation for the `transform` property. Any change to the element's transform (like rotation) will take 0.3 seconds to complete with an "ease" timing function (slow start, fast middle, slow end). This is crucial for the rotation animation when the footer is opened or closed.

### `.footer-toggle .caret.open`

This class is applied dynamically (presumably via JavaScript) to the caret element when the footer content is visible. It modifies the base `.caret` style.

-   **`transform: rotate(180deg);`**: Rotates the caret element 180 degrees around its center. This is used to flip the caret vertically (e.g., from pointing down to pointing up) to visually signify that the content area is expanded. The actual animation is handled by the `transition` property in the base `.caret` class.

### `.footer-content`

This class styles the container for the detailed content of the footer, which is shown or hidden by the toggle.

-   **`margin-top: 15px;`**: Adds 15 pixels of margin above the content area, separating it from the `.footer-toggle` element.
-   **`padding-top: 15px;`**: Adds 15 pixels of padding to the top of the content area, creating space between its top border and the actual content within it.
-   **`border-top: 1px dashed #ccc;`**: Places a 1-pixel thick, dashed, light-gray border at the top of the content area, providing a distinct visual separation from the toggle control above it.
