This configuration file manages the connection point for the application's backend services. Its primary function is to ensure that the user interface (frontend) knows exactly where to send requests for data, such as fetching user profiles or submitting new information. It intelligently switches the destination address based on whether the application is being tested by developers or is running live for customers.

The business value of this component is maintaining seamless operational continuity. By correctly routing communication between the user-facing application and the core data processing system, we guarantee that users receive accurate, up-to-date functionality whether they are using the application during development or accessing the finalized product in a live environment. This prevents connection errors and ensures data integrity across all deployment stages.
