## Algorithms and Data Structures

1.  **Validation Check (Boolean Logic):** Simple truthiness check followed by `instanceof` operator for type validation.
2.  **Asynchronous Module Loading (Promises):** Utilizes the ECMAScript standard `import()` function, which returns a `Promise`. This ensures that the main thread execution is not blocked waiting for the performance library to load.
3.  **Metric Registration (Function Calls):** The core mechanism relies on the `web-vitals` library's design pattern where each metric getter function (`getCLS`, etc.) takes a callback (`onPerfEntry`) as an argument and executes it when the corresponding metric is finalized during the user's session.

## Dependencies

This file explicitly depends on the external library:
*   `web-vitals` (loaded dynamically via `import('web-vitals')`)
