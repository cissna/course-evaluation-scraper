This file represents the main application screen, acting as the central hub that brings all features of the Course Evaluation Analyzer together. It manages the user's entire workflow, from searching for a course to viewing its detailed evaluation data. The component dynamically changes the view to show a search bar, a list of results, or the final analysis, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

The business purpose of this component is to provide a single, cohesive interface where users can transform raw course evaluation data into actionable insights. It allows users to not only access course ratings but also to interact with the data by applying filters (like time range) and separating results (e.g., by professor). This empowers students to make more informed decisions about their academic planning by providing a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for comparing courses and instructors.
