This utility module standardizes how the application determines the relevant academic or business periods based on the current date. It contains core logic that defines specific cutoff dates for different reporting or operational cycles (such as Intersession, Spring, Summer, and Fall). Its primary function is to accurately calculate what the "current" operational period is and define historical timeframes, like the "last three years," ensuring consistency with established backend definitions.

The business value of this module is maintaining accurate, synchronized reporting and data access across the system. By strictly defining and calculating the current period based on fixed annual cutoff dates, the application ensures that users viewing reports or interacting with time-sensitive features are always looking at the correct, officially designated academic timeframe. This consistency prevents errors in data segmentation, historical analysis, and compliance reporting tied to specific operational cycles.
