### Executive Summary: Data Analysis Processing Utility

This component serves as the core engine for processing raw course or evaluation data to generate meaningful, summarized statistics for non-technical users. Its primary function is to take raw performance feedback—such as ratings on instructor quality or workload—and convert them into easily digestible metrics like averages and trends. This system allows stakeholders to define specific slices of the data they are interested in (e.g., only courses taught in the last five years by a specific department) and then calculates the relevant performance scores for those selected groups.

The business value of this engine lies in its ability to transform complex, granular survey responses into actionable business intelligence. By standardizing how statistics are calculated and presented (e.g., grouping results by instructor or academic term), leadership can quickly assess performance across different segments of their offerings. This standardized calculation ensures consistency when comparing results year-over-year or instructor-by-instructor, supporting data-driven decisions regarding curriculum quality, resource allocation, and instructor support programs.
