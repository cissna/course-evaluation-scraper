*   **`reportWebVitals()`**:
    *   **Function Signature**: Assumed to be `reportWebVitals(handler?)`, where `handler` is optional.
    *   **Purpose**: This function, typically generated by Create React App (CRA), collects metrics like FCP (First Contentful Paint), LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), etc., once the application has loaded enough to measure them.
    *   When called without arguments (as done here), it usually logs these metrics to the browser console or sends them to a default analytics endpoint configured within `reportWebVitals.js`.
    *   The surrounding comments explain how a developer could customize this behavior by passing a custom logging function.

## Summary of Execution Flow

1.  Dependencies are imported.
2.  Vercel analytics tracking code is injected into the document.
3.  The DOM element with ID 'root' is located.
4.  A React 18 concurrent root is established on that element.
5.  The application's main component (`App`) is rendered inside the `StrictMode` context into the DOM root.
6.  The Web Vitals reporting mechanism is initiated to asynchronously collect and report performance data.
