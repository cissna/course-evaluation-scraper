This file is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the performance experience of our web application as perceived by our users. It collects key metrics that measure how quickly the application loads, becomes interactive, and remains stable during use. Essentially, it acts as a system to constantly check the 'speed and responsiveness' of the user interface.

The business value of this monitoring is critical for ensuring a positive customer experience, which directly impacts user retention and conversion rates. By proactively measuring these performance indicators, we can identify bottlenecks and areas where the application feels slow or unresponsive to users. This allows our development team to make targeted improvements that result in a faster, more reliable product, ultimately leading to happier customers and better business outcomes.
