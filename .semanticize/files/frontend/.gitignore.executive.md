This configuration file serves as a "do not share" list for the project's source code repository. It specifies which temporary files, local developer settings, and other non-essential data should be excluded from the central codebase.

The primary business value is improved security and efficiency. By automatically ignoring sensitive configuration files, it prevents accidental exposure of private credentials. Furthermore, it keeps the shared project folder clean and focused on the core application code, which streamlines development and reduces the risk of errors caused by irrelevant or machine-specific files.
