## Frontend Component Dependency Snapshot

This document provides a high-level overview of the dependencies used to build and test the application's user interface (Frontend component). This file, `package-lock.json`, ensures that every future build uses the exact same versions of all underlying software libraries, guaranteeing consistency and stability across development, testing, and production environments.

The primary purpose of these dependencies is to support a modern, interactive user experience and ensure high quality through rigorous testing. Key functional areas supported by these tools include rendering the interface (using **React**), providing a robust environment for automated **testing** to catch functional bugs early, and enabling **web performance monitoring** to track user experience metrics. This dependency structure supports rapid, reliable development of the customer-facing application.
