This utility script serves as a foundational tool to ensure that necessary core components of our system can be located and accessed correctly when running specific administrative or setup tasks. Its primary function is to prepare the environment so that specialized processing modules—which contain the logic for system operations—can be imported and executed without interruption.

The business value of this helper is enabling the reliable execution of one-time setup, migration, or administrative operations that require access to the main application logic. By guaranteeing that these critical background processes can find and use the required system functions, we ensure that necessary data preparation, initial configurations, or specialized data handling tasks can be completed smoothly and successfully, supporting major project milestones or system updates.
