This script is a utility designed to perform a specific administrative reset within our system's data. Its sole function is to globally clear a specific warning indicator, referred to as the "grace period flag," that is attached to records representing our courses. This action effectively resets any accumulated status or notice related to this grace period across the entire course catalog simultaneously.

The business value of this tool lies in its ability to provide a clean slate or a fresh start for course status tracking when needed. For example, if we are launching a new policy or if existing grace period warnings need to be universally dismissed before a major operational review, this script allows administrators to efficiently reset these indicators without manual intervention for every single course. This ensures consistency and saves significant manual effort during necessary system resets.
