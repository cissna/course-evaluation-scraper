# Module: `one-time-scripts/clear_grace_period_flags.py`

This script is designed as a standalone utility to perform a database maintenance task: specifically, resetting the grace period tracking flag across all course metadata records.

## Big Picture Understanding

This script provides a mechanism to globally "reset" the state related to grace period tracking for course scraping. The flag `last_scrape_during_grace_period` in the `course_metadata` table is used to mark courses that were scraped while operating under a grace period rule. Running this script nullifies those flags, effectively clearing any existing warnings or special handling associated with that prior state.

## Components

### Function: `clear_grace_period_flags()`

**Summary:**
This function connects to the PostgreSQL database, queries the `course_metadata` table to count how many records currently have the `last_scrape_during_grace_period` flag set, updates all those records to set the flag to `NULL`, and then confirms the operation by recounting the remaining flagged records.

**What it does:**
1.  Loads database credentials from environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`).
2.  Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2`.
3.  Executes a `SELECT COUNT` to determine the initial number of flagged courses.
4.  Executes a bulk `UPDATE` statement to set `last_scrape_during_grace_period = NULL` only for rows where it is currently non-null.
5.  Executes a final `SELECT COUNT` to verify the number of remaining flagged courses.
6.  Commits the transaction upon success or rolls back upon failure.
7.  Handles resource cleanup (closing cursor and connection) in a `finally` block.

**High-Level Interaction Patterns:**
This function is intended to be executed manually or via a scheduled job when a global reset of grace period state is required. It interacts directly with the database via a connection string loaded from the environment. It follows a standard transactional pattern: read state -> modify state -> commit/rollback -> close connection.

## Execution Context

The script includes an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, meaning it is executable directly from the command line to perform its intended database operation.
