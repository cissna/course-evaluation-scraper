# Developer Documentation for `one-time-scripts/backend_import_helper.py`

This script serves a single, crucial purpose: **dynamically configuring the Python import path** to allow one-time scripts to access modules located within a sibling `backend` directory.

This is typically necessary when running standalone utility or migration scripts that need to leverage core library or service code that resides outside the standard Python path structure relative to the script's execution location.

## Component Analysis

The file contains no classes and primarily relies on standard library functions (`os`, `sys`).

### Functions

This file does not define any user-facing functions. Its operations are executed immediately upon script import/execution.

### Interaction Patterns

1.  **Path Determination:** It calculates the absolute path to a sibling directory named `backend` relative to the location of this helper script itself.
    *   `os.path.dirname(__file__)`: Gets the directory containing this script.
    *   `os.path.join(...)`: Safely constructs the path to the target `backend` directory.

2.  **Path Manipulation:** It inserts the calculated `backend_dir` path at the *beginning* (index 0) of `sys.path`.
    *   `sys.path.insert(0, backend_dir)`: This action ensures that subsequent imports attempted by the calling script (or any module imported after this helper) will resolve modules first from the `backend` directory.

**In essence, this script acts as a bootstrapping utility for environment setup.** Any script that executes or imports this file gains immediate access to modules within `./backend/` without requiring complex environment variable configuration or relative path workarounds.
