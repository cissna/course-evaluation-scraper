# Technical Documentation for `clear_grace_period_flags.py`

This script is designed as a one-time utility to reset a specific flag (`last_scrape_during_grace_period`) associated with course records in the database. This is typically used to clear out existing "grace period warnings" across all tracked courses.

## Overview

The script connects to a PostgreSQL database using credentials loaded from environment variables, queries the count of records where the grace period flag is set, updates all these records to set the flag to `NULL`, and then verifies the update by recounting the remaining flagged records.

## Dependencies

| Module | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `os` | Used for accessing environment variables. |
| `psycopg2` | PostgreSQL adapter for Python, used for database interaction. |
| `dotenv.load_dotenv` | Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file (if present). |

## Function Specification

### `clear_grace_period_flags()`

**Description:**
Connects to the PostgreSQL database, counts the number of courses where `last_scrape_during_grace_period` is set (not NULL), updates these records to set the column to `NULL`, and reports the changes.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Return Value:**
None. (The function prints status messages to standard output and handles errors via printing and database rollback/commit.)

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Environment Loading:** Calls `load_dotenv()` to load configuration from `.env`.
2.  **Connection String Retrieval:** Retrieves the database connection string using `os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")`. If not found, it prints an error and exits.
3.  **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection (`conn`) to PostgreSQL using `psycopg2.connect(conn_string)`.
4.  **Cursor Initialization:** Creates a cursor object (`cur`) for executing SQL commands.
5.  **Pre-Update Count:**
    *   **SQL:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM course_metadata WHERE last_scrape_during_grace_period IS NOT NULL`
    *   Executes the query and fetches the result to determine `count_before`.
6.  **Flag Clearing (Update):**
    *   **SQL:** `UPDATE course_metadata SET last_scrape_during_grace_period = NULL WHERE last_scrape_during_grace_period IS NOT NULL`
    *   This command efficiently targets only those rows that currently have the flag set, setting the value to SQL `NULL`.
7.  **Post-Update Count:**
    *   **SQL:** Repeats the count query from step 5 to determine `count_after`.
8.  **Transaction Commit:** Calls `conn.commit()` to make the `UPDATE` operation permanent.
9.  **Reporting:** Prints the initial count, the number of rows updated (`count_before - count_after`), and the final count.
10. **Error Handling (`try...except...finally`):**
    *   If any exception occurs during database operations, it prints the error message.
    *   If an error occurs, it checks if `conn` exists and calls `conn.rollback()` to undo any partial changes (though the primary operation is a single `UPDATE`).
    *   The `finally` block ensures that the cursor (`cur`) and connection (`conn`), if successfully established, are always closed to release database resources.

## Near Line-by-Line Analysis

| Line(s) | Code | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-3 | `import os`, `import psycopg2`, `from dotenv import load_dotenv` | Imports necessary standard library modules and the third-party library for environment loading. |
| 5 | `def clear_grace_period_flags():` | Defines the main function. |
| 6-9 | `"""..."""` | Docstring explaining the function's purpose. |
| 10 | `load_dotenv()` | Loads environment variables from `.env` file into the environment. |
| 11 | `conn_string = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")` | Retrieves the PostgreSQL connection string from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. |
| 12-14 | `if not conn_string: ... return` | Checks if the connection string was successfully loaded. If not, prints an error and terminates the function execution. |
| 16 | `try:` | Starts the main block for operations that might raise exceptions (I/O, database errors). |
| 17 | `conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_string)` | Establishes the connection to the PostgreSQL database. |
| 18 | `cur = conn.cursor()` | Creates a cursor object used to execute SQL commands. |
| 21 | `cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM course_metadata WHERE last_scrape_during_grace_period IS NOT NULL")` | Executes SQL to count all rows in `course_metadata` where the grace period flag is explicitly set (not NULL). |
| 22 | `count_before = cur.fetchone()[0]` | Fetches the single result (the count) from the executed query and extracts the integer value. |
| 24 | `print(f"Found {count_before} courses with grace period flags set.")` | Reports the initial count. |
| 27 | `cur.execute("UPDATE course_metadata SET last_scrape_during_grace_period = NULL WHERE last_scrape_during_grace_period IS NOT NULL")` | Executes the core update operation: setting the flag to `NULL` only for rows where it was previously set. |
| 30 | `cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM course_metadata WHERE last_scrape_during_grace_period IS NOT NULL")` | Executes the count query again to find how many flags remain set after the update. |
| 31 | `count_after = cur.fetchone()[0]` | Fetches the final count. |
| 33 | `conn.commit()` | Persists the changes made by the `UPDATE` statement to the database. |
| 35-36 | `print(...)` | Reports the success message, calculating the number of updated rows (`count_before - count_after`) and the remaining count. |
| 38 | `except Exception as e:` | Catches any exception raised during the `try` block. |
| 39 | `print(f"Error clearing grace period flags: {e}")` | Logs the error message. |
| 40-41 | `if 'conn' in locals(): conn.rollback()` | If an error occurred and a connection object exists, rolls back any partial transaction state. |
| 43 | `finally:` | Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. |
| 44-47 | `if 'cur' in locals(): ... if 'conn' in locals(): ...` | Ensures that the cursor and connection objects are properly closed to free up database resources, provided they were successfully created (checked via `locals()`). |
| 49 | `if __name__ == "__main__":` | Standard Python entry point check. |
| 50 | `clear_grace_period_flags()` | Executes the main function when the script is run directly. |
