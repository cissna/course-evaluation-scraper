# File: one-time-scripts/jhu_as_en_courses.txt

This file is a plain text listing of course codes, likely intended for use in a one-time script or data migration process related to Johns Hopkins University (JHU) courses, specifically focusing on courses prefixed with "AS" (Academics/Arts & Sciences or similar grouping) and "EN" (English or Engineering, depending on context), and a few others like "MI" (Miscellaneous/Medical/Interdisciplinary) and "PE" (Physical Education).

Since this file contains no executable code, functions, or classes, the documentation focuses on the structure and implied purpose of the data it contains.

## Data Structure and Purpose

The file consists entirely of course identifiers, each on a new line. These identifiers follow a consistent, dotted-notation pattern: `[PREFIX].[DEPARTMENT_CODE].[COURSE_NUMBER]`.

**Example Pattern:** `AS.001.100`

### Components Analysis

| Component | Description | Implied Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prefix** | The first segment (e.g., `AS`, `EN`, `MI`, `PE`). | Likely denotes a high-level school, division, or subject area (e.g., AS=Arts & Sciences, EN=English/Engineering). |
| **Department Code** | The second segment (e.g., `001`, `500`, `990`). | Represents a specific department or subject group within the prefix division. |
| **Course Number** | The final segment (e.g., `100`, `899`, `010`). | The specific identifier for the course within that department. |

### High-Level Understanding

This file serves as a static, comprehensive list of specific JHU course codes. Its primary use case, given the path `one-time-scripts/`, is likely to:

1.  **Seed a database table** with valid course identifiers.
2.  **Map or cross-reference** existing course data during a system update or migration.
3.  **Define a canonical list** of courses relevant to a specific project (e.g., an English program catalog, judging by the large `EN` entries).

### Interaction Patterns (Implied)

A script processing this file would typically:

1.  Read the file line by line.
2.  Parse each line into its constituent parts (Prefix, Department, Number).
3.  Insert or update a corresponding record in a course catalog or mapping table in a backend system.
