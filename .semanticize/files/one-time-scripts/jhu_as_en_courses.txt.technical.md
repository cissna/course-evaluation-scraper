# Technical Documentation: `one-time-scripts/jhu_as_en_courses.txt`

## Overview

The file `one-time-scripts/jhu_as_en_courses.txt` is a plain text file containing a long list of alphanumeric codes, each appearing on its own line. Based on the file name (`jhu_as_en_courses.txt`), these codes strongly suggest they represent **course identifiers** from a system associated with Johns Hopkins University (JHU), likely used for data migration, cleansing, or reference purposes within an academic or administrative system.

The file format is extremely simple: a sequence of distinct course codes separated by newline characters.

## File Structure and Content

The file consists entirely of lines, where each line contains one course code.

**File Path:** `one-time-scripts/jhu_as_en_courses.txt`
**Data Type:** Plain Text (List of Strings)
**Encoding:** Assumed to be standard ASCII or UTF-8 (since the characters are standard alphanumeric).

### Course Code Format

The observed course codes follow a consistent pattern:
`XX.YYY.ZZZ` (or variations where some parts might be missing or use different separators, but the provided data primarily uses the dot separator).

*   **Prefix (e.g., `AS`, `EN`, `ME`, `MI`, `PE`):** Typically two characters, likely indicating the **School, Department, or Subject Area**. (e.g., `AS` for Arts & Sciences, `EN` for Engineering, `ME` for Mechanical Engineering, etc.).
*   **Middle Segment (e.g., `001`, `500`, `990`):** Usually three digits, potentially representing the **Division, Level, or Program**.
*   **Suffix (e.g., `100`, `899`, `010`):** Usually three digits, likely representing the **Specific Course Number** within that division/level.

### Near Line-by-Line Equivalent Detail

Since this file is a simple list, line-by-line documentation describes the content of each line:

| Line Number (Approx.) | Content Example | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `AS.001.100` | A course code starting with 'AS', middle segment '001', suffix '100'. |
| 2 | `AS.001.101` | A course code starting with 'AS', middle segment '001', suffix '101'. |
| ... | ... | ... |
| N | `PE.401.040` | A course code starting with 'PE', middle segment '401', suffix '040'. |

The file contains hundreds of entries, listing course codes across various prefixes (`AS`, `EN`, `ME`, `MI`, `PE`).

## Implementation Details and Algorithms

This file is purely a **data repository**. It does not contain executable code, algorithms, or complex data structures beyond a simple list of strings.

### Data Structures

*   **File Content:** A sequential list of strings, where each string is a course identifier.
*   **In-Memory Representation (if processed):** Typically loaded into an array or list of strings.

### Processing Context (Inferred)

Given the file name convention (`one-time-scripts/...`), this file is intended to be read once by a script (likely a Python, shell, or similar utility) to perform a specific, non-recurring task. This task is almost certainly related to:

1.  **Data Mapping/Normalization:** Ensuring consistency of JHU course identifiers across different systems.
2.  **Filtering/Selection:** Providing a definitive list of courses relevant to a specific migration or ETL process.
3.  **Validation:** Serving as a master list against which other data sets are checked.

No interpretation or transformation logic is present *within* the file itself.

## Function Signatures and Return Values

Since this is a static data file and not a source code file containing functions, there are no function signatures, parameters, or return values to document here. The file serves as input data for external processes.
