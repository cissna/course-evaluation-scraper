- **Line 22 (`batch_scrape_report_*.json`)**: Ignores any JSON files that match this pattern, which appear to be reports generated by a batch scraping process. These are outputs, not application source code.
- **Line 23 (`jhu_as_en_courses.txt`)**: Ignores a text file that likely contains a list of courses, probably used as an input for a local script. It is not part of the runtime application.
- **Line 24 (`one-time-scripts/`)**: Ignores the entire directory containing scripts intended for single-use tasks like database setup, data migration, or exporting. These scripts are not part of the backend API or frontend application and are not required for the deployed application to function.
