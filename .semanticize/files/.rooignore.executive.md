This configuration file acts as an exclusion list, instructing our internal systems which files to ignore during data processing and analysis. It is currently set up to exclude a file named `metadata.json`, which stores supplementary information about the course data we collect.

The business value of this file is in improving system efficiency and focus. By preventing our tools from processing certain data files, we conserve computational resources and ensure that our analysis is concentrated on the most critical information. This practice streamlines our operations, leading to faster performance and more cost-effective data management.
