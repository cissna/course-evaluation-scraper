The `backend/__init__.py` file serves as a foundational organizational component for the application's backend system. Its presence designates the `backend` folder as a structured package, allowing different parts of the server-side code to be neatly organized and to interact with each other correctly.

This file is crucial for maintaining a clean, reliable, and scalable architecture. By ensuring the backend is properly structured, it supports the long-term health of the application, making future updates and maintenance more efficient and less prone to errors. This contributes directly to the stability and overall quality of the course evaluation platform.
