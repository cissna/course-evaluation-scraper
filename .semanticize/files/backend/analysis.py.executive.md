The Analysis Engine is the core component responsible for processing and interpreting raw course evaluation data. It takes the detailed feedback collected for individual courses and transforms it into clear, summary statistics. This engine can analyze data for a single course or intelligently combine data from a group of related courses (e.g., those that are cross-listed) to provide a more comprehensive and accurate overview.

The primary business value of this component is its ability to turn large volumes of complex data into actionable insights for students, faculty, and academic advisors. By allowing users to filter results by criteria like academic year or instructor, it enables them to understand historical trends in course quality, workload, and teaching effectiveness. This supports informed decision-making, helping students choose courses and providing departments with valuable feedback for academic planning and improvement.
