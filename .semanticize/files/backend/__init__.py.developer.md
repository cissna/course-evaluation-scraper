# backend/__init__.py

This file marks the `backend` directory as a Python package.

Its presence allows the Python interpreter to recognize the directory as a package, enabling the import of modules and subpackages from within it. For example, it allows other parts of the application to import `app.py` or other backend modules.

This file is intentionally left empty.
