# Technical Documentation for `backend/__init__.py`

## 1. Overview

This file, `backend/__init__.py`, is an essential component of the Python package structure for the Flask backend of the JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer.

## 2. Code Description

The file is currently empty.

## 3. Functional Analysis

In Python, the presence of an `__init__.py` file within a directory indicates to the interpreter that the directory should be treated as a package or subpackage. This allows modules and subpackages within the `backend` directory to be imported elsewhere in the project.

Even though it contains no code, its existence serves this critical purpose. It enables the modular organization of the backend source code, allowing different components like `app.py`, `db_utils.py`, and `scraper_service.py` to be part of the `backend` package.
