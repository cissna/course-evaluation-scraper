This component is responsible for automatically finding the web links to individual course evaluation reports on the official university website. When a user searches for a specific course, this tool navigates the site on their behalf, gathering the direct links for every available report associated with that course, including different semesters and instructors. It essentially acts as an automated data scout, locating the exact source of the evaluation data we need.

The business value of this component lies in its ability to automate the first and most critical step of our data collection process. By automatically discovering where the evaluation reports are located, it eliminates the need for manual searching and ensures our system can always access the most current data directly from the source. This automation is the foundation of our application, enabling all subsequent analysis and display features by providing a reliable and up-to-date stream of information.
