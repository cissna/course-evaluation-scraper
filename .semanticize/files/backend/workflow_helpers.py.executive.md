This component is the primary engine for automatically gathering course evaluation data from the university's official source. It logs into the system, locates all evaluation reports for a given course, and downloads any new information that has not yet been saved. The system is designed to be highly efficient, focusing only on collecting the most recent data to ensure the application stays current.

The business value of this component lies in its ability to provide reliable, up-to-date, and complete course evaluation data without manual effort. It intelligently navigates the university's website, even when reports are spread across many pages, ensuring no information is missed. By automating the data collection process and keeping a record of when courses were last updated, it guarantees that users are always viewing the most comprehensive and timely data available, which is crucial for making informed decisions.
