This component serves as the application's internal timekeeper, managing all logic related to academic schedules. It automatically determines the current academic period (e.g., Fall, Spring) based on today's date, and it can identify the oldest and newest semesters for which course data exists. This capability is essential for understanding the timeframe of the available evaluation data.

The business value of this component lies in its ability to keep the course evaluation data current and relevant. By comparing the date of the last data refresh against the current academic calendar, it ensures the system automatically fetches new evaluations as they become available. This process guarantees that users are always viewing the most up-to-date information possible, which builds trust and makes the application a more reliable tool for academic planning. It also improves operational efficiency by preventing unnecessary checks for new data, saving system resources.
