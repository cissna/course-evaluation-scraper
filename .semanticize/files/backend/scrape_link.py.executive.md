This component is responsible for automatically gathering detailed feedback for a single course from the university's official evaluation website. It navigates to a specific course evaluation page and extracts key information, including the course title, the instructor's name, and the aggregated student ratings on topics like "overall quality" and "instructor effectiveness."

The business value of this component lies in its role as the primary data-gathering engine for the entire application. By automatically and reliably collecting this information, it ensures the data presented to users is accurate and sourced directly from the official records. This automation eliminates the need for manual data entry, which saves significant time and prevents human error. Its resilient design allows it to handle intermittent connection problems, ensuring the application is built on the most complete and trustworthy dataset possible.
