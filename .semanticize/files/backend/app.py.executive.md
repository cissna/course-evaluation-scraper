This component is the main backend server for the JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer. It functions as the central hub that connects the user-facing web application to the underlying data. When a user searches for a course or instructor on the website, this server receives the request, gathers the appropriate evaluation data from the database, and sends it back to be displayed. If the data is outdated or missing, it automatically collects the latest information from the university's official source.

The primary business value of this component is to make course evaluation data accessible to the application's users. It powers the core features of the platform, such as searching for courses, viewing detailed evaluation reports, and analyzing trends across different classes. By serving as the single point of contact for all data requests, it ensures that the information presented to users is consistent, accurate, and up-to-date, directly enabling students and faculty to make informed decisions based on the evaluation data.
