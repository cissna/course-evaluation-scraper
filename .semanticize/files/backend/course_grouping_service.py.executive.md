The Course Grouping Service automatically bundles related courses together to provide a more complete and accurate picture of their evaluation history. Many courses at the university are offered under different course numbers, such as undergraduate and graduate versions of the same class, or courses that are cross-listed between departments. This service uses a set of predefined rules to identify and group these equivalent courses.

The primary business value is the enhancement of the user experience and the quality of data analysis. By consolidating the evaluation data from all related course offerings, we provide students with a single, comprehensive view of a course's history. This allows them to make better-informed decisions when selecting classes, as they have access to a much richer and more complete dataset, preventing them from missing relevant feedback simply because it was filed under a different course code.
