This component serves as the central data manager for the entire application, handling all interactions with the course evaluation database. It is responsible for establishing a secure connection to the data storage system and provides the necessary functions to read, write, and update all course-related information. This includes storing the raw evaluation data scraped from the university website as well as metadata that helps manage the data, such as when a course was last updated.

The business value of this component lies in its ability to provide a reliable and organized foundation for the application's data. It powers the core search functionality, enabling users to easily find courses by their name or by an instructor's name. It also intelligently groups different but related courses (e.g., cross-listed courses) into a single, easy-to-understand search result. By centralizing all data operations, this module ensures data integrity and consistency, which is critical for delivering accurate and trustworthy information to users and simplifying the overall system architecture.
