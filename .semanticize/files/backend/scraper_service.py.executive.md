This component acts as the central hub for managing and delivering course evaluation data. Its main responsibility is to retrieve course information when a user requests it. The service intelligently determines whether to use recently saved data for a fast response or to fetch the most current information directly from the university's systems, ensuring the data is always as up-to-date as possible.

The business value of this service lies in its ability to provide users with timely and accurate course evaluation data efficiently. By caching information, it enhances the application's speed and reduces redundant data collection, leading to a better user experience. It also includes a crucial search feature that allows users to easily find courses and provides an option to manually trigger a data refresh, ensuring users can trust they have access to the latest available information.
