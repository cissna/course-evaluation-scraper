The JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer is a web application that provides students and faculty with easy access to course and instructor feedback. It automatically gathers evaluation data directly from the university's official sources and presents it in a searchable, user-friendly interface. Users can look up specific courses, view historical evaluation data, and filter the information by criteria such as instructor or academic year.

This tool provides significant value by transforming scattered, hard-to-find data into a centralized and actionable resource. It empowers students to make more informed decisions when selecting courses and helps faculty and administration gain valuable insights into student feedback, supporting efforts to enhance curriculum and teaching quality. By making this information transparent and accessible, the application fosters a more informed and engaged academic community.
