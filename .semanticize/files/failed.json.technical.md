## 3. Implementation Details

This file acts as a simple, file-based database for logging errors. It is likely read from and written to by the backend scraping service.

### Key-Value Breakdown

-   **`"AS.080.312.02.FA17"`**: This is the key. It identifies a specific section (02) of the course `AS.080.312` that was offered in the Fall 2017 (`FA17`) semester. Each key is unique to a single course offering.

-   **`scrape_failed: true`**: This field explicitly confirms that the entry represents a failure. While redundant given the file's purpose, it makes the data structure explicit and self-documenting.

-   **`reason`**: This field provides a concise summary of the failure type.
    -   **`"overall_quality_frequency missing after successful requests"`**: This reason indicates that the scraper successfully made HTTP requests and likely received a valid response from the server. However, upon parsing the response, a critical piece of data—the frequency distribution for the "overall quality" of the course—was not found. This suggests an issue with the scraper's parsing logic or an unexpected change in the structure of the source webpage for that specific course evaluation.
    -   **`"network_error"`**: This reason signifies that the failure occurred at the network level. The scraper was unable to establish a connection or receive a timely response from the evaluation server.

-   **`exception`**: This field is conditionally present and provides low-level detail for network errors.
    -   **`"HTTPSConnectionPool(...) Read timed out."`**: This specific exception message indicates that the scraper sent a request but did not receive a response from the server within the configured timeout period (10 seconds in this case). This could be due to server-side issues, network latency, or firewall configurations.

## 4. Usage and Context

The `failed.json` file is a component of the application's data persistence and error-handling strategy.

-   **Error Logging**: The primary purpose is to create a persistent record of scraping failures without relying on a more complex logging system or database for this specific task.
-   **Debugging**: Developers can inspect this file to identify patterns in scraping failures. For example, a large number of `network_error` entries might point to a systemic network problem, while a prevalence of parsing-related reasons could indicate that the source website's HTML structure has changed.
-   **State Management**: The application might use the presence of a course in this file to avoid retrying a known-failing scrape immediately, potentially implementing a backoff strategy before the next attempt.
