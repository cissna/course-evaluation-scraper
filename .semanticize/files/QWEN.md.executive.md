The JHU Course Evaluation Analyzer is a web application that provides students with easy access to course and instructor evaluation data. It automatically gathers the most current information from the university and presents it in a searchable, user-friendly format. This allows students to analyze feedback on different courses, compare instructors, and view historical trends, helping them make more informed decisions when selecting their classes.

The primary business value of this application is to empower students by making complex evaluation data simple to navigate and understand. By replacing an older, manual system with a modern, cloud-hosted solution, the application ensures that the information is always available, reliable, and up-to-date. This provides a significant advantage to students during the critical time of course registration, supporting their academic planning and helping to improve their overall educational experience at Johns Hopkins University.
