This database schema defines the foundational structure for storing all course evaluation information. It organizes the data into two main categories: one for high-level course metadata, such as the course code and the last time its data was successfully updated, and another for the detailed evaluation data for each specific course instance (e.g., for a particular semester and instructor). This separation allows the system to efficiently manage and retrieve information, ensuring quick access and data integrity.

The business value of this component lies in its role as the central repository for all application data. By creating a well-organized and reliable storage system, it enables the application to deliver fast, accurate, and up-to-date course evaluation insights. This organized structure is critical for the application's performance and its ability to support informed decision-making by students and faculty. It also includes an automated mechanism to track updates, which helps maintain the quality and timeliness of the data presented to users.
