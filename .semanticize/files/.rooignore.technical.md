# .rooignore Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview

The `.rooignore` file is a configuration file used by the Roo-AI development environment to specify files and directories that should be excluded from its indexing and analysis processes. This mechanism is conceptually similar to a `.gitignore` file, which tells the Git version control system which files to ignore. By listing paths in `.rooignore`, developers can prevent certain files from being processed, which is useful for large data files, sensitive information, or files that are not relevant to the codebase's semantic understanding.

## 2. File Content Analysis

The file contains a single entry and a comment.

### Line 1: `metadata.json`

- **Purpose**: This line explicitly instructs the Roo-AI system to ignore the file named `metadata.json` located in the project's root directory.
- **Implementation**: When the Roo-AI indexer scans the project directory, it reads the patterns from this file. Upon encountering `metadata.json`, it will match this entry and skip the file, preventing its contents from being included in the project's semantic index.
- **Comment Rationale**: The associated comment, `# currently under 1mb, so it will be indexed unless we rooignore it`, explains the reasoning. Roo-AI likely has a default file size limit (e.g., 1MB) above which it automatically ignores files. Since `metadata.json` is smaller than this threshold, it would normally be indexed. The developer has made a deliberate choice to exclude it, likely because its contents are not considered relevant source code or documentation for AI-assisted tasks.

### Line 2: `# data.json # over 1mb so it won't be indexed so we can leave it out`

- **Purpose**: This line is a comment and is not functionally processed by the ignore mechanism.
- **Explanation**: The comment documents the decision *not* to add `data.json` to the `.rooignore` file. It states that `data.json` is larger than the automatic indexing size limit (implied to be 1MB). Therefore, the Roo-AI system will ignore it by default, making an explicit entry in `.rooignore` redundant. This comment serves as a note to future developers explaining the absence of `data.json` from the ignore list.

## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Data Structure**: The `.rooignore` file is a simple text file where each line represents a pattern. These patterns are typically stored in a list or a set by the indexing tool.
- **Algorithm**: The matching algorithm is a form of pattern matching. For each file and directory found during a file system traversal, the path is compared against the list of patterns loaded from `.rooignore`. If a match is found, that file or directory (and its children, if it's a directory) is excluded from further processing. The matching logic usually supports glob patterns (e.g., `*.log`, `build/`), although this specific file only uses a direct filename match.
