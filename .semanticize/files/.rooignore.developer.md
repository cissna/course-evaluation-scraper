# .rooignore Developer Documentation

## Overview

This file specifies files and directories to be ignored by the local indexing and retrieval system. Its purpose is to prevent certain files from being included in the context provided to the AI, which is especially useful for large data files, logs, or other content that is not relevant to code analysis.

## Configuration Details

### `metadata.json`

- **Purpose**: This entry explicitly excludes `metadata.json` from being indexed.
- **Reasoning**: Although `metadata.json` is small enough to be indexed by default (under the system's 1MB limit), it contains data scraped from the course evaluation system, not source code. Excluding it keeps the AI's context focused on the application's logic and structure.

### `data.json` (Commented Out)

- **Purpose**: The comment for `data.json` explains why it is *not* explicitly ignored.
- **Reasoning**: The file `data.json` exceeds the 1MB automatic indexing limit. Therefore, it is already excluded by default, and no explicit entry in `.rooignore` is necessary. This highlights the system's default behavior of ignoring large files.
