## 3. Implementation Details Summary

| Dependency | Role | Installation Method | Version Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `psycopg2-binary` | Database Connector (PostgreSQL) | Pre-compiled binaries | Latest stable version |
| `python-dotenv` | Configuration Management | Standard package installation | Latest stable version |

**Note on Version Pinning:**
Since no version specifiers (e.g., `==1.2.3` or `>=2.0`) are included after the package names, the installation process will default to installing the latest compatible version available on PyPI at the time `pip install -r requirements.txt` is executed. For production or reproducible environments, it is standard practice to pin versions (e.g., `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9`).
