This configuration file provides essential operational and security guidelines for the AI assistant. Its primary function is to safeguard sensitive information by explicitly preventing the assistant from accessing specific internal data files, including raw data collections, error logs, and other operational records. This creates a clear boundary, ensuring the AI only interacts with approved information sources.

The business value of this configuration lies in its enhancement of data security and privacy. By restricting access to raw and potentially sensitive data, we minimize the risk of accidental exposure and ensure that the AI operates within a controlled and secure environment. This proactive measure is a critical component of our data governance strategy, protecting key information assets while allowing the development team to leverage the AI assistant for its intended purposes safely.
