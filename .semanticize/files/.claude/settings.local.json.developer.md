# Claude Local Settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)

This configuration file defines local settings and permissions for the Claude AI assistant, tailoring its behavior specifically for this project. It ensures the assistant operates safely and aligns with the project's architectural principles.

## Configuration Details

### `outputStyle`

-   **Purpose**: Controls the verbosity and style of the AI's responses.
-   **Value**: `"Explanatory"`
-   **Effect**: Instructs the AI to provide detailed, context-rich explanations rather than brief, direct answers. This is useful for getting a deeper understanding of the code or the AI's reasoning.

### `permissions`

-   **Purpose**: Manages the AI's access to the project's file system, acting as a security and safety mechanism.
-   **`deny` block**: Contains a list of explicit rules that prevent the AI from performing specific actions on specified file patterns.

#### Denied Actions

The configuration explicitly denies `Read` access to the following files:

-   `**/data.json/**`
-   `**/failed.json/**`
-   `**/metadata.json/**`

**Developer-Level Impact**: This is a critical security and architectural constraint. It prevents the AI from directly reading raw, potentially large, or sensitive data files. Instead, the AI (and by extension, the developer using it) is forced to interact with application data through the intended abstractions, such as the backend API or database utilities. This encourages adherence to the project's data access patterns and prevents accidental data leakage or misinterpretation.
