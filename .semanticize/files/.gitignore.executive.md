The `.gitignore` file serves as a "do not track" list for the project's codebase. It tells the development tools to ignore specific files and folders that are not part of the core application, such as temporary files, developer-specific settings, and automatically generated content.

This is essential for maintaining a clean, secure, and efficient workflow. By filtering out unnecessary files, we prevent clutter and reduce the risk of accidentally sharing sensitive information. This ensures that the official codebase remains streamlined and consistent for all team members, which helps speed up development and minimize errors.
