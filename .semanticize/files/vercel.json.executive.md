This configuration file defines how our application is structured and deployed onto the Vercel platform. Essentially, it acts as the blueprint for ensuring both the user-facing website and the underlying operational services are correctly assembled and made available online. It directs the deployment process to handle the necessary steps for building the front-end (what the user sees) and setting up the back-end logic (where data processing and core functions reside).

The primary business value of this file is ensuring a seamless, high-performance digital experience for our customers and efficient operations for our team. By clearly defining these roles, we guarantee that user requests are routed correctly—whether they require static assets like images and interface elements, or dynamic processing handled by our core application logic—leading to reliable service delivery and optimal resource utilization.
