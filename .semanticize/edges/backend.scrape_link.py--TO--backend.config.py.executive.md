The `scrape_link.py` module relies on configuration settings defined in `config.py` to manage the reliability and retry behavior of its web scraping function. Specifically, `scrape_evaluation_data` imports `MAX_RETRIES` and `INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY` from `config.py` to control how aggressively it attempts to fetch data from external URLs, ensuring the scraping process is robust against temporary network or loading issues.
