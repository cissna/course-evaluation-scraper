The `analysis.py` file relies on the `CourseGroupingService` (imported from `course_grouping_service.py`) to determine which related courses should be aggregated when calculating statistics for a primary course.

**Business-Level Connection:**

1.  **Course Aggregation:** When a user requests statistics for a specific course (e.g., "AS.100.101"), the system needs to know if this course is part of a larger, established curriculum group (like a sequence of core courses or departmental offerings).
2.  **Service Lookup:** `analysis.py` calls methods on the `CourseGroupingService` (specifically `get_group_info` within `process_analysis_request`) to retrieve a list of other course codes that should be included in the statistical calculation.
3.  **Data Consolidation:** `analysis.py` then uses this list of grouped course codes to fetch their individual data (via `get_course_data_and_update_cache`) and consolidates them with the primary course's data before filtering and calculating the final aggregated statistics.

In essence, the **`CourseGroupingService` defines the rules for grouping related courses**, and **`analysis.py` executes the aggregation** based on those rules when generating reports.
