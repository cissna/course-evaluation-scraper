The `analysis.py` module is responsible for processing raw course performance data (like student ratings) and calculating aggregate statistics, often based on user-defined filters or groupings.

The `scraper_service.py` module is responsible for actively acquiring the raw course data from external sources (web scraping) and maintaining the local data cache.

**Relationship:**

`analysis.py` **depends on** `scraper_service.py` to ensure the data it analyzes is fresh and comprehensive. Specifically, the analysis process in `analysis.py` calls the function `get_course_data_and_update_cache` from `scraper_service.py` when it needs to retrieve performance data for a primary course or any courses it needs to group with it. In essence, the scraper service acts as the data provider that feeds the analysis engine.
