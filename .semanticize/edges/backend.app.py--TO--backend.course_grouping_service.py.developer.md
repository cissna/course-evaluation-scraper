The Flask application in `backend/app.py` utilizes the `CourseGroupingService` class imported from `backend/course_grouping_service.py` to handle course grouping logic, specifically within the `/api/analyze/<string:course_code>` endpoint.

**High-Level Interaction:**

1.  **Instantiation:** In `backend/app.py`, an instance of the service is created during initialization: `grouping_service = CourseGroupingService()`.
2.  **Usage in Analysis Endpoint:** The `/api/analyze` route uses this instance to determine if the requested course is part of a defined group (e.g., cross-listed or equivalent versions).
    *   It calls `grouping_service.get_group_info(course_code)` to retrieve structural information about the course group, including the list of related course codes (`courses`) and a group description.
    *   This information is crucial for the analysis endpoint to fetch data from *all* related instances (the main course and its grouped counterparts) using `get_course_data_and_update_cache`, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for processing.

**Component-Level Relationship:**

*   **Dependency:** `backend/app.py` has a **dependency** on `backend/course_grouping_service.py` to implement advanced data aggregation logic based on predefined course groupings.
*   **Functionality Used:** The primary method consumed is `get_group_info(course_code)`, which returns a dictionary detailing the grouping structure if one exists for the given course code.
*   **Interaction Pattern:** The interaction is a synchronous request/response pattern where the API layer queries the service layer for structural grouping metadata before proceeding with data fetching and analysis.
