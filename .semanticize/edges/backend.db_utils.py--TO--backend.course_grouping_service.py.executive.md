The `db_utils.py` module, specifically within the functions `find_courses_by_name_with_details_db` and `count_courses_by_name_db`, **relies** on the `CourseGroupingService` class defined in `course_grouping_service.py`.

**Business Connection:**

The data layer (`db_utils.py`) is responsible for retrieving raw course records from the database. However, for user-facing features like searching or counting courses, the system needs to present unified views of courses that are functionally equivalent (e.g., different offerings of the same core concept across different levels or terms).

The `CourseGroupingService` module provides the business logic to define and manage these relationships (groupings). `db_utils.py` uses this service to consolidate the raw database results into meaningful, grouped results before returning them to the application layer. Essentially, the database fetching logic depends on the grouping rules to accurately report course catalog information.
