The `db_utils.py` file acts as a data access layer (DAL) for database operations, while `course_grouping_service.py` implements business logic for grouping courses.

The relationship is a **dependency** where the database utility functions are imported and utilized by the grouping service to perform complex data retrieval and counting operations that rely on grouping logic.

### High-Level Interaction

1.  **Functionality Used:** `course_grouping_service.py` imports and uses functions from `db_utils.py` to fetch raw course data (`courses` table) and then processes this data using its internal grouping logic.
2.  **General Interaction Patterns:**
    *   **Search and Grouping:** In `find_courses_by_name_db`, the service imports `CourseGroupingService` to instantiate it, and then uses the database to find raw course matches (`find_courses_by_name_db` uses `get_db_connection` internally). Crucially, the database function itself instantiates and uses `CourseGroupingService` *during* its query execution flow (`from .course_grouping_service import CourseGroupingService`). This indicates a tight coupling where the database interaction logic relies on the grouping service to resolve unique groups from the raw DB results.
    *   **Counting:** Similarly, `count_courses_by_name_db` relies on `CourseGroupingService` to deduplicate the search results into unique groups after fetching the raw matching course codes from the database.

### Component-Level Relationship

*   **`db_utils.py` (Source):** Provides generic, reusable database connection management (`get_db_connection`) and CRUD/query operations for `course_metadata` and `courses` tables.
*   **`course_grouping_service.py` (Target):** Contains the core business logic for defining and identifying related courses (grouping) based on department patterns or explicit lists.

**Key Observation:** The dependency structure is somewhat circular/mutually dependent for advanced features:
1.  `db_utils.py` (`find_courses_by_name_db`, `count_courses_by_name_db`) imports `CourseGroupingService` (from `.course_grouping_service`) to process the results it fetches from the database, effectively using the grouping logic to enhance the search results *within* the DB utility layer.
2.  Conversely, `CourseGroupingService` (the target file) is designed to be used by other parts of the application (like the service functions in `db_utils.py`) to resolve groups.

This suggests that the search/listing functionality bridges the DAL (`db_utils`) and the business logic (`course_grouping_service`) by embedding the business logic component into the complex query procedures within the DAL file.
