The `scraper_service.py` relies on configuration constants defined in `config.py` to manage its operations effectively. Specifically, the scraping service uses parameters like `PERIOD_RELEASE_DATES` and `PERIOD_GRACE_MONTHS` (imported from `config.py`) to determine when course data is considered "up-to-date" and when to apply grace period logic during data retrieval. This demonstrates a dependency where the core service logic is governed by time-sensitive parameters set and maintained in the configuration file.
