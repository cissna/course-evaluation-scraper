The `scraping_logic.py` component requires a specific web address (the `AUTH_URL`) to perform its core function: establishing a secure connection needed to start scraping data. This address is provided and managed by the `config.py` file, which acts as the central source of truth for all necessary setup values, including critical URLs, ensuring the scraping process connects to the correct external system.
