The `scraper_service.py` acts as the main orchestrator for gathering course data. It relies on the `scraping_logic.py` to handle the foundational step of establishing a secure connection to the external data source. Specifically, `scraper_service.py` calls `get_authenticated_session` from `scraping_logic.py` whenever it needs to initiate a scraping operation (either a standard update or a forced recheck) to ensure it has the necessary credentials to proceed. This establishes a dependency where the service needs the logic provider to handle secure access.
