The `analysis.py` module depends on `CourseGroupingService` defined in `course_grouping_service.py` to handle course grouping logic required during statistical analysis preprocessing.

**Interaction Details:**

1.  **Import:** `analysis.py` imports `CourseGroupingService` from its sibling module:
    ```python
    from .course_grouping_service import CourseGroupingService
    ```

2.  **Instantiation:** An instance of the service is created globally in `analysis.py` to be used throughout the module's functions:
    ```python
    grouping_service = CourseGroupingService()
    ```

3.  **Usage in `process_analysis_request`:** The instantiated `grouping_service` is primarily used within `process_analysis_request` to determine if the primary course belongs to a structured group of courses (derived from department patterns or explicit configurations defined in the service).
    *   It calls `grouping_service.get_group_info(primary_course_code)` to retrieve a list of related course codes (`grouped_courses`) and a description. This information is crucial for aggregating data from multiple related course offerings into a single analysis group.

**Component Relationship:**

*   **`analysis.py` (Consumer):** Relies on the grouping service to resolve related course codes for data aggregation when analyzing a primary course. It uses the service's methods to fetch grouping details before filtering and calculating statistics.
*   **`course_grouping_service.py` (Provider):** Provides the business logic for defining and retrieving course equivalents based on fixed configuration files (`metadata.json` or embedded defaults). It encapsulates knowledge about which course codes should be analyzed together.
