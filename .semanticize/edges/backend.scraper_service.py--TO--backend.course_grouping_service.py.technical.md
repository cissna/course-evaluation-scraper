The `scraper_service.py` file has a direct dependency on `course_grouping_service.py` via a relative import:
`from .course_grouping_service import CourseGroupingService`.

1.  **Instantiation:** An instance of the imported class is created globally in `scraper_service.py`:
    ```python
    grouping_service = CourseGroupingService()
    ```
    This suggests that `scraper_service.py` uses the `CourseGroupingService` class to perform course grouping or related logic during its scraping workflow, although no explicit methods from `grouping_service` are called in the provided functions (`get_course_data_and_update_cache`, `force_recheck_course`, `get_course_grace_status`, `find_courses_by_name`, `find_courses_by_name_with_details`).

2.  **Relationship Summary:** `scraper_service.py` consumes the `CourseGroupingService` class defined in `course_grouping_service.py` to potentially manage or resolve course groupings, likely for internal data processing or API responses that are not fully visible in the provided functions. The dependency flows strictly from the scraper service to the grouping service.
