This instantiation occurs globally within `analysis.py`.

The `analysis.py` file then interacts with the instantiated `grouping_service` object in the `process_analysis_request` function when `primary_course_code` is provided:

1.  **Function Call**: `grouping_service.get_group_info(primary_course_code)` is called.
    *   **Purpose**: To retrieve information about other courses that should be grouped with the primary course for analysis.
    *   **Input**: `primary_course_code` (str).
    *   **Output**: A dictionary (`group_info`) containing `"courses"` (list of grouped course codes) and `"description"`.

This interaction shows that `analysis.py` relies on `CourseGroupingService` to determine course equivalencies and group structures, which are then used to aggregate data from multiple course instances (`get_course_data_and_update_cache` is called later based on this grouping information). The `CourseGroupingService` handles the logic defined in its configuration (either loaded from a file or its embedded defaults) to establish these groups.
